How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs requires a deep understanding of the problem domain and the goals of the end-users. I approach this by engaging closely with stakeholders, gathering their requirements, and translating these into clear, actionable user stories. User stories are vital as they break down user needs into manageable, specific tasks that guide development. By focusing on the "who, what, and why" of a feature, user stories ensure that the team builds exactly what is needed, aligning the product closely with user expectations and business goals.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to developing programs is heavily influenced by Agile principles, which emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress. I believe in starting with a minimal viable product and iterating based on feedback. Agile processes like Scrum, with its emphasis on sprints, daily stand-ups, and continuous integration, are processes I aim to incorporate into all future development work. These processes not only help manage the complexity of development but also ensure that the team remains aligned and responsive to changes in project requirements.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to both the technical and collaborative aspects of a project. This involves not only writing clean, efficient code but also engaging in open communication, sharing knowledge, and offering support to fellow team members. It means being reliable, meeting deadlines, and being flexible enough to adapt to changes. A good team member understands the value of collective success and works towards it by fostering a positive, productive environment.
